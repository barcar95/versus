# Versus 

## Description 

Versus is an engaging and interactive platform created to allow users to make decisions by comparing two items in a friendly, versus style competition. Whether its a versus between what car is faster, which anime character is stronger, or even something as simple as what color is better than the other, Versus allows users to cast their vote and see what the community also thinks! 


## Getting Started and Usage

To get started with Versus, simply visit our website and sign up for a free account. 

![home page](https://github.com/pinkhaze/versus/assets/131290908/c67c42de-f6db-46e7-b2d5-c37e68e364b4)

![signup page](https://github.com/pinkhaze/versus/assets/131290908/d8ebf5e7-e92d-44a9-aac3-cbc99e090cfa)


Once logged in, the user will be taken back to the home page where they can start casting their votes.

At the top navigation bar, users will see different tabs they're able to click. One of them being "Create Matchup." Once clicked, a user is able to create a matchup between two items of their choice and let the community decide which of the two is best.

Another tab in the top navigation bar is the "Profile" tab. This tab allows users to see their previous matchups that they created, and a "See Comments" tab that will show the comments other users made related to that matchup.
