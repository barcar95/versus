# Versus 

## Description 

Versus is an engaging and interactive platform created to allow users to make decisions by comparing two items in a friendly, versus style competition. Whether its a versus between what car is faster, which anime character is stronger, or even something as simple as what color is better than the other, Versus allows users to cast their vote and see what the community also thinks!
